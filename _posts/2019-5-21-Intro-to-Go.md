title: How I started with Go!
---

After recently starting my internship at Nutanix, I was assigned to NCC team and my task was to improve Logbay. As it was written in Go, I started to learn the language.

I spent my first week learning it, and then proceeded with reading Logbay's codebase. I refered to the following resources for that:
[A tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/list) and [Go by Examples](https://gobyexample.com)
After completing the above two, I did some exercises from: [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com)

Awesome article for getting started with unit testing in go:
[Writing unit tests - alex ellis' blog](https://blog.alexellis.io/golang-writing-unit-tests/)

I still have a lot to learn and will keep this post updated, writing how I went on doing it.
